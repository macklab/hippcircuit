# Segmentation labels

Each segmenation software provides its label file. All these files are posted in this folder for easy access. Depending on the research question, specific labels/segmentations can be isolated and/or combined. Here, we isolate the hippocampal subfields from MAGeTbrain and entorhinal cortex from ASHS/ITK-SNAP. We then combine them in a new segmentation image for each subject. `subfield_MTL_label.txt` is the final label file that matches the connectivity matrices created for this segmentation image (i.e., includes hippocampal subfields and entorhinal cortex.)
