# Entorhinal cortex segmentation using ASHS & ITK-SNAP
Medial temporal regions were segmented using cloud based ASHS through ITK-SNAP. Please note that you can only submit 10 subjects at a time. Segmented images were then transferred to Niagara. Store the segmented images in the following directory for easier access:

$bids_dir/derivatives/itk-snap/sub-*

You can extract the regions of your interest from the segmented images. In this project, we specifically isolated the entorhinal cortex to combine it with hippocampal subfields from MAGeTbrain.
