# MAGeTbrain on Niagara
The CobraLab has graciously given us access to their software stack on Niagara. If your Compute Canada account is associated with the mmack group, you will have access. 
## Activating MAGeTbrain
Everytime you use MAGeTbrain, the following two commands must be run:

    > module load cobralab/2019b
    > source project/software/MAGeTbrain
